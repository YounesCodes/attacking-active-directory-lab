# ATTACKING ACTIVE DIRECTORY

Hands-on Active Directory attack lab covering LLMNR poisoning, SMB relay, IPv6/mitm6 relays to LDAPS, Kerberoasting, GPP credential extraction, token impersonation, and post-compromise enumeration using BloodHound, PowerView, CrackMapExec, and Impacket. Built full attack chains from initial foothold to DCSync and Golden Ticket persistence, with detailed mitigation analysis for each vector.

TO-DO: make a diagram depicting lab components (DC, client, firewall...)
